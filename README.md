# **Introduction**

This project is a HTML website based on a game reserve (animal wild life park) in Zambia called “South Luangwa National Park”. This README file aims to explain the motivation of this project and show plans and wireframes of the website and the process of development with the design features. 

# **Motivation**

My journey to Africa in 2016 had inspired me to use it as a theme of this project. Seeing the amazing scenery and wildlife, capturing great images and experiencing life in Africa had made me want to go again and inspire others also to pay a visit in such a place. 

# **Design Principles (PARC)**

## **Proximity**
This has been addressed in this website in a few places for example on the about us page an accordion was placed with sections although grouped closely together. This helps with the vision for the user as each section contain their own topic however the format is similar.

## **Alignment**
All pages have very similar layouts, with slight differences. The elements of each page are very well placed and are not just scattered all over the place. Even when the screen size changes the item on the page moves accordingly and is placed in suitable positions.

## **Repetition**
All pages are similar with slight difference. The main aspects are repeated on each page such as the header and footer. Having these things repeated throughout the website allows the user to have knowledge of the whereabouts of the items of the website. This helps the user as they do not need to keep looking for where things are such as the navigation bar, which is a key aspect of the website

## **Contrast**
The website has green broken with a whitish background.

# **Development process**

### **Four web pages** 
–Index (Homepage)
-About (some information about the park)
-Gallery (some images of animals in the park)
-Contact (Contact form the user can fill out).

# **Design Features**
Mobile first – the website was designed taking the mobile first approach which ensures the responsiveness of the site is effective.
Use of API’s – a Wikipedia search was integrated into the site for users to search for any extra information they would like to access such as a particular type of animal.
Validated pages – all HTML and CSS were tested and validated and successfully passed with no errors.
Responsive layout - 

# **Obstacles**

Having created a single style sheet which contained all styles, without any of the styles affecting others. 
I wasn’t used to using Git and Github and didn’t know the commands very well, however after using it a few times I had got the hang of it.

# **Testing**

Having let various people, both computer literate and not, browse and navigate around the website without any assistance from anybody with me over their shoulder supervising and inspecting what they are doing and what happens on the site when they looked through it. Having doing so helped in finding any faults and improvements, which would need to be made.
